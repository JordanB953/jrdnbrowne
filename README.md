### Howdy howdy!

I'm deeply grateful of all the open source projects I use on a daily basis and want to help contribute to them and hopefully start new ones as well.

I'm committed to this work because I want to see a more abudant and free society where people work on whatever they find interesting and exciting instead of being forced to work a job just to survive.
